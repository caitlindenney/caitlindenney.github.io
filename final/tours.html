                <h2>When is The Best Time to Visit Cozumel? </h2>
                <p>You can visit Mexico year-round, but the best time to visit Cozumel is during the months from March
                    to
                    June, before the hurricane season commences. The hottest months are July and August which coincides
                    with
                    the hurricane season that lasts until November. Winter is Cozumel’s busiest period and it runs from
                    December through to March. </p>

                    Carmen (to take the boat over to Cozumel). You can either take the bus, hire a taxi, or opt for a
                    shuttle from Cancun to Playa del Carmen. This is the fastest, safest, and most comfortable to get to
                    the

                <p>A visit to the family-owned and operated Cozumel Pearl Farm is a unique excursion where you are taken

                        Company.
                        Who does not love chocolate?! One of the many things Mayans are known for was their production
                        of
                        chocolate from the beans of the cacao trees. After the fermenting, drying and roasting process,
                        they
                        ground the beans into a paste, added hot water and made the first hot chocolate drink. The tour

                    miss. With its protected area and shallow water, this beach is suitable for all levels of
                    swimmers and snorkellers. As a bonus, Playa Chen Rio is located on the east coast, which is less
                    popular than those beaches that are located on the west coast — perfect if you want to get away
                    from the crowds. Enjoy a day of swimming and snorkelling, followed by lunch or dinner at one of
                    the great restaurants on the beach here.</p><a target="_blank"

                <h2>12. Visit San Miguel, the Capital of Cozumel</h2>
                <p>Since San Miguel is located on the west coast, one of the best activities here is to walk the
                    broad sidewalk along the seafront at sunset. During the day when the cruise ships are in port,
                    the sidewalk is busy with cruise passengers, but outside of that time, it is quiet. In the
                    middle of San Miguel is the Zocalo (a central park), every Mexican city or town has a Zocalo. It
                    is a meeting place for locals or a spot to sit down and just ‘people watch’. If you are in
                    Cozumel on a Sunday evening head to the Zocalo at around 8:00 pm for many free events. </p><a

                <h2>13. Experience Temazcal Cozumel</h2>
                <p>A Temazcal is an ancient Mayan ceremony, and while it is one of the top things to do in Cancun,
                    it is also an incredible experience here in Cozumel. You will enter a brick hut which is warmed
                    by volcanic rocks – like an experience in a sauna – and will be greeted by a Shaman. During the
                    Temazcal ritual, your body is put through a process of cleansing, relaxing and purification. It
                    ends with a cooling swim in the nearby cenote. The whole ceremony is a very spiritual experience
                    and if you have a chance, do not miss it </p> <a target="_blank"

                    different Cozumel restaurants where you enjoy a Mexican dish and a local drink. The places you
                    will visits are off the usual tourist path, meaning you will be eating like a local. Even
