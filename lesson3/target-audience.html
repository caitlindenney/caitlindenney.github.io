    <p>The audiance that I’m going for are those in Preston, ID., Soda Springs, CA., and Fish Haven, ID.</p>
    <h2>personas:</h2>
    <h3>active people</h3>
    <p>My first group are those who like to be active outside.
        My website will give accurate weather so they don’t have to worry about it suddenly changing on them. </p>
    <h3>Just want to know what the weather is going to be</h3>
    <p>My second group is those who just want to look at the weather every day.
        They can go on and see what the weather is going to be like. </p>
    <h2>Scenarios:</h2>

    <p>Where do I find a radar map? <br>Just hover over the city’s name and the radar tab will drop down. </p>
    <h3>two</h3>
    <p>Where is the local news? <br>It is on the home page as well as national news near the bottom. </p>
    <h3>three</h3>

        forecast when it drops down. </p>
    <h3>four</h3>
    <p>What site do you get you information from? <br>I get my information from
        <a link="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/">Storm Center</a>. </p>
    <h3>five</h3>
